# CSC 211H Fall 2021 Final Project

# Project Title

Just Do It

## Inspiration
Due to Covid-19, people have been staying indoors and their lifestyles have changed dramatically. Once active people now stay indoors and rarely get out as much. Going out and finding new things to do is what life is about.
## What it does
The purpose of this app is to let people add challenges or activities they find fun into a database so they're more likely to get out and do it. It is harder to convince yourself to stay in when you have a list of things you can go out and do.
